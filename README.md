# CXRLT24 Multiview PP

This repository contains our solution for the MICCAI 2024 CXR-LT (Chest X-Ray Long-Tailed) challenge, achieving 4th place in Subtask 2 and 5th in Subtask 1.

## Project Overview

We present an ensemble method for long-tailed chest X-ray (CXR) classification using ConvNeXt V2 and MaxViT models. Our approach combines state-of-the-art image classification techniques with asymmetric loss for handling class imbalance and view-based prediction aggregation to enhance overall performance.

### Key Features

- Ensemble of ConvNeXt V2 and MaxViT models
- Domain-specific pretraining on NIH Chest X-ray dataset
- Asymmetric loss function to address long-tailed distribution
- View-based prediction aggregation for multi-view CXR studies
- Effective data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
